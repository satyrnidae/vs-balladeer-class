Introducing the Balladeer!

The **Balladeer** is a utility-focused class which sacrifices a lot of utility with regard to mining and combat in exchange for buffing their fellow Seraphs instead.  As long as they are playing an instrument (specifically an ABC file\*) they apply buffs to healing effectiveness, hunger rate, temporal decay, walk speed, and both melee and ranged attacks to any allies within a 20.5-by-5 radius ellipsoid (squished sphere). The range of the effect is configurable.

Note that this class is likely not well balanced, especially in single player where the Balladeer likely suffers without any friends to buff. Use at your own discretion.
