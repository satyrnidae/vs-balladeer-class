# The Balladeer: A Musical Buff Class

Requires [Instruments](https://mods.vintagestory.at/show/mod/463)\* and [CAN Effects](https://mods.vintagestory.at/effectshud)


*\* I also recommend [Instruments QuackPack](https://mods.vintagestory.at/show/mod/17850) for some nice default instruments and the starting accordion.*\

The **Balladeer** is a utility-focused class which sacrifices a lot of utility with regard to mining and combat in exchange for buffing their fellow Seraphs instead.  As long as they are playing an instrument (specifically an ABC file\*) they apply buffs to healing effectiveness, hunger rate, temporal decay, walk speed, and both melee and ranged attacks to any allies within a 20m radius.

Note that this class is likely not well balanced, especially in single player where the Balladeer likely suffers without any friends to buff. Use at your own discretion.

*\* More information about ABC files is available on the [Instruments](https://mods.vintagestory.at/show/mod/463) page*
